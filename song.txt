I'm the devil's son straight out of hell
And you're an angel with a haunted heart
If you're smart you'd run and protect yourself
From the demon living in the dark
There's nothing to be gained cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)


Save yourself
From a life full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself
From the choices I make cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself


You're the perfect drug when it hurts like hell
I've never needed anyone so much
There's no one else I love and I curse myself
Cause the right thing is to give you up
I'm overcome by shame cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)


Save yourself
From a life full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself
From the choices I make cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself
Save yourself
Save yourself


You'll never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)
Cause I don't understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)


Save yourself
From a life full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself
From the choices I make cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself
Save yourself
Save yourself
