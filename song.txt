I'm the devil's son straight out of hell
And you're an angel with a haunted heart
If you're smart you'd run and protect yourself
From the demon living in the dark
There's nothing to be gained cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)


Save yourself
From a life full of lies and a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself
From the choices I make cause nothing but failure follows me
Save yourself
